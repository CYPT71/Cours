    \section{introduction}
        
    In this document we will see how we proced the task and why we make the golang chose for programming, after that we will speak about the tools we use.


    The projet is on our github in two part, first part is purlly the backend and maybe in the future the front end in two separates files. \newline\newline

    The seconde part is functionnal, it permit to create table, fill it and run it. We have also put a docker file to create the mysql server and PhpMyAdmin.
   
    
    \section{Backend Part}

    We choose golang for the backend because is more efficency and fastest than python. 

    We enter in the Backend file witch contains files and folders.

    The .air.toml we see is a config file for auto reload the API.

    The config.yaml is the config file for the API.

    The file go.mod and go.sum is for the golang modules.

    We see a directory named internal.

        In internal

    we see three directories
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item http
            \item sql request
            \item utils
        \end{enumerate}

    the utils is for loadding configuration into the server \newline\newline

    the folder http contains two directories and one file " http.go ". The file is like the main file for running the API.  

    The folder middlewares contain securty constrain and controllers all the handler for the API. \newline\newline

    Back to the sql request folder, it contains just all the code for making request to the data base. \newline\newline

    Each tables have it handler and it sql request file. \newline
